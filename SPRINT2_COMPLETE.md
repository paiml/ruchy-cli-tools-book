## Key Learnings

### Technical

1. **String Algorithms**:
   - Manual line parsing with character iteration
   - Case-insensitive matching with `.to_lowercase()`
   - Edge cases: files without trailing newlines

2. **TDD Process**:
   - GREEN → REFACTOR → PROPERTY → QUALIFY cycle works
   - Commit each phase separately
   - Property tests verify invariants effectively

3. **Tool Ecosystem**:
   - Dramatic improvement since Sprint 1
   - 6/7 bugs fixed (86% success rate)
   - 50% → 100% pass rate improvement

### Process

1. **Stop The Line**:
   - 3 events total, all handled properly
   - User enforcement helps maintain discipline
   - Quick bug fixes reward quality collaboration

2. **Documentation**:
   - Authentic journey > idealized tutorial
   - Showing improvement over time is valuable
   - Metrics validate quality

3. **Collaboration**:
   - Ruchy team extremely responsive
   - Detailed bug reports get fast fixes
   - Quality benefits entire community

## Challenges Overcome

### Challenge 1: Bug #37 (Test Assertions)

**Impact**: Blocked TDD RED phase verification
**Solution**: Stopped, filed bug, Ruchy team fixed quickly
**Time Lost**: < 1 day
**Lesson**: Stop The Line works consistently

### Challenge 2: split() Not Available in Tests

**Impact**: Cannot use built-in split() function in test environment
**Solution**: Implemented manual character-by-character line parsing
**Time Lost**: None - simple workaround
**Lesson**: Manual approaches can be more reliable

### Challenge 3: return Statement Syntax

**Impact**: Syntax error with bare `return` in main()
**Solution**: Restructured to use if-else instead of early return
**Time Lost**: Minutes
**Lesson**: Learn Ruchy syntax patterns
