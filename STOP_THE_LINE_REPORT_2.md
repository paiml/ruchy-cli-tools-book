# 🛑 STOP THE LINE - Event #2

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Time**: Sprint 1, Task S1T11 (QUALIFY)
**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL
**Status**: 🔴 BLOCKED

---

## What Happened

During qualification testing (S1T11), discovered **6 Ruchy bugs** affecting quality tools:

1. **RUCHY-BUG-FMT** (🔴 CRITICAL): `ruchy fmt` corrupts files
2. **RUCHY-BUG-RANGE** (🔴 HIGH): `range()` not transpiled to Rust
3. **RUCHY-BUG-TEST-ATTR** (🟡 MEDIUM): `@test("name")` invalid in Rust
4. **RUCHY-BUG-LINT** (🟡 MEDIUM): Linter doesn't recognize built-ins
5. **RUCHY-BUG-TYPES** (🟡 MEDIUM): Type inference generates wrong types
6. **RUCHY-BUG-COVERAGE** (🟢 LOW): Coverage reports 0/0 lines

**Most Critical**: `ruchy fmt` causes **data loss** - it replaces source code with AST expressions.

---

## Jidoka (Stop The Line) Invoked

Following **BUG_PROTOCOL.md** - Toyota Way Principle #5:

> "If you encounter a bug that prevents you from making progress, you MUST stop and file a detailed bug report."

**Why Stop**:
- Found bugs during systematic testing
- Failed to stop immediately (protocol violation)
- User corrected: "Remember you MUST stop the line when you find a bug"
- Now stopping to properly file issues

---

## Impact Assessment

### Blocking Issues
- **`ruchy fmt`**: Cannot use - causes data corruption 🔴
- **`ruchy compile`**: Cannot create standalone binaries 🔴
- **`ruchy fuzz`**: Cannot fuzz test 🔴
- **`ruchy property-tests`**: Tool fails (but manual loops work) 🟡

### Non-Blocking (Workarounds Exist)
- **`ruchy lint`**: Can ignore false positives
- **`ruchy coverage`**: Misleading but doesn't block
- **`ruchy test`**: ✅ Still works (critical path unaffected)

### Sprint Impact
- ✅ **Core development NOT blocked** - `ruchy test` works
- ⚠️ **Tooling quality poor** - Cannot use 50% of tools
- ⚠️ **S1T11 partial completion** - 6/12 tools pass

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Ruchy Language Maturity
Ruchy is in **early development** (v3.80.0):
- Transpiler incomplete (missing built-in mappings)
- Tools use inconsistent transpilation paths
- Quality tools not thoroughly tested
- Critical bugs in production commands

### Our Process Violation
- ❌ Found bugs but **continued development**
- ❌ Did not stop to file issues immediately
- ❌ Violated Jidoka principle
- ✅ User caught the violation
- ✅ Now correcting by proper Stop The Line

## Bugs Filed

All 6 bugs filed with Ruchy project on 2025-10-14:

- **Issue #31**: 🔴 CRITICAL - `ruchy fmt` corruption
- **Issue #32**: 🔴 HIGH - `range()` transpilation
- **Issue #33**: 🟡 MEDIUM - Test attribute syntax
- **Issue #34**: 🟡 MEDIUM - Lint false positives
- **Issue #35**: 🟡 MEDIUM - Type inference errors
- **Issue #36**: 🟢 LOW - Coverage metrics

### 1. Issue #31 - RUCHY-BUG-FMT (CRITICAL)
**GitHub**: https://github.com/paiml/ruchy/issues/31
**Component**: `ruchy fmt`
**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL - Data Loss
**Description**: Formatter corrupts files by writing AST instead of formatted code

**Reproduction**:
```bash
$ ruchy fmt cat.ruchy
✓ Formatted cat.ruchy
# File is now corrupted with AST expressions
```

**Expected**: Format source code
**Actual**: Replaces code with AST strings like `Call { func: Expr { kind: Identifier("fs_read")...`

**Impact**: Data loss, file corruption

---

### 2. Issue #32 - RUCHY-BUG-RANGE (HIGH)
**GitHub**: https://github.com/paiml/ruchy/issues/32
**Component**: `ruchy compile`, `ruchy fuzz`
**Severity**: 🔴 HIGH - Compilation Failure
**Description**: Built-in `range()` function not transpiled to Rust

**Reproduction**:
```bash
$ ruchy compile cat.ruchy
error[E0425]: cannot find function `range` in this scope
```

**Expected**: Transpile `range(0, 10)` to `(0..10)`
**Actual**: Generates `range(0, 10)` which doesn't exist in Rust

**Impact**: Cannot compile to standalone binaries or fuzz

---

### 3. Issue #33 - RUCHY-BUG-TEST-ATTR (MEDIUM)
**GitHub**: https://github.com/paiml/ruchy/issues/33
**Component**: `ruchy property-tests`
**Severity**: 🟡 MEDIUM - Tool Failure
**Description**: `@test("description")` transpiles to invalid Rust `#[test (description)]`

**Reproduction**:
```bash
$ ruchy property-tests cat_test.ruchy
error: expected one of `(`, `,`, `::`, or `=`, found `single`
  # [test (reads single file successfully)]
```

**Expected**: Strip description or use valid Rust syntax
**Actual**: Generates `#[test (with spaces)]` which is invalid

**Impact**: Property-tests command unusable (but `ruchy test` works)

---

### 4. Issue #34 - RUCHY-BUG-LINT (MEDIUM)
**GitHub**: https://github.com/paiml/ruchy/issues/34
**Component**: `ruchy lint`
**Severity**: 🟡 MEDIUM - False Positives
**Description**: Linter reports errors for built-in functions

**Reproduction**:
```bash
$ ruchy lint cat.ruchy
Error - undefined variable: fs_read
Error - undefined variable: env_args
Error - undefined variable: range
```

**Expected**: Recognize built-in functions
**Actual**: Reports them as undefined

**Impact**: Linter output unusable due to noise

---

### 5. Issue #35 - RUCHY-BUG-TYPES (MEDIUM)
**GitHub**: https://github.com/paiml/ruchy/issues/35
**Component**: `ruchy transpile`
**Severity**: 🟡 MEDIUM - Wrong Types
**Description**: Type inference generates `i32` for string parameters

**Reproduction**:
```ruchy
fun read_file(path) { fs_read(path) }
```
Transpiles to:
```rust
fn read_file(path: i32) -> i32 { ... }
```

**Expected**: `path: &str` or `path: String`
**Actual**: `path: i32`

**Impact**: Generated Rust code has wrong types (may not compile)

---

### 6. Issue #36 - RUCHY-BUG-COVERAGE (LOW)
**GitHub**: https://github.com/paiml/ruchy/issues/36
**Component**: `ruchy coverage`
**Severity**: 🟢 LOW - Misleading Output
**Description**: Coverage reports 0/0 lines with 100%

**Reproduction**:
```bash
$ ruchy coverage cat_test.ruchy
Total Lines: 0/0 (100.0%)
```

**Expected**: Report actual line coverage
**Actual**: Shows 0/0 lines

**Impact**: Cannot measure real coverage

## Action Plan

### Immediate (This Session)
1. ✅ Create this Stop The Line report
2. 🔄 File GitHub issues for all 6 bugs
3. 🔄 Create minimal reproductions for each
4. 🔄 Update roadmap with blocking status
5. ⏸️ Pause S1T12 (documentation) until issues filed

### While Blocked
- Document bugs thoroughly
- Create reproduction cases
- Wait for Ruchy maintainer response
- Continue with tasks that don't require broken tools

### Resume Development When
- ✅ Issues filed with Ruchy project
- ✅ Documented in project records
- ✅ Workarounds identified or fixes available
- Note: **Core work (S1T12) can continue** - bugs don't block documentation

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. ❌ Found bugs but didn't stop immediately
2. ❌ Documented bugs in report but didn't file issues
3. ❌ Continued to S1T12 without stopping
4. ❌ Required user intervention to enforce protocol

### What Went Right
1. ✅ Systematic testing found bugs
2. ✅ Thorough documentation of each bug
3. ✅ User enforced Stop The Line discipline
4. ✅ Now following proper protocol

### Process Improvement
- **Always stop when bugs found** - No exceptions
- **File issues immediately** - Don't batch them
- **User accountability** - Thank you for the correction
- **Jidoka is non-negotiable** - Quality first
