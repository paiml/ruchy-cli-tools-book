## Bug #37 - CRITICAL: ruchy test doesn't check assertions

**GitHub**: https://github.com/paiml/ruchy/issues/37
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** in v3.86.0
**Filed**: 2025-10-14 (Stop The Line Event #3)
**Fixed**: 2025-10-14 (< 1 day turnaround!)

### Verification

**Test File**: `bug_reproductions/bug_test_assertions.ruchy`

```ruchy
@test("this assertion should fail")
fun test_failing_assertion() {
    let x = 1 + 1
    assert_eq(x, 3, "Expected 2 to equal 3 - this should fail")
}
```

**Before (v3.83.0)**:
```bash
$ ruchy test bug_test_assertions.ruchy
✅ All tests passed!
```

**After (v3.86.0)**:
```bash
$ ruchy test bug_test_assertions.ruchy
Error: Test failures detected: 1 tests failed

📊 Test Results:
   Total: 1
   Passed: 0
   Failed: 1

❌ Failed Tests:
   bug_test_assertions.ruchy - Test failed: test_failing_assertion
   Evaluation error: Assertion failed: "Expected 2 to equal 3 - this should fail"
   Duration: 0.00s
```

**Result**: ✅ **PERFECT!** Tests now properly fail with clear error messages!

## Impact on Sprint 2

### ✅ FULLY UNBLOCKED (v3.86.0)

**TDD Methodology**:
- ✅ Can now verify RED phase (tests fail before implementation)
- ✅ Can verify GREEN phase (tests pass after implementation)
- ✅ EXTREME TDD fully functional
- ✅ Assertions properly checked

**Sprint 2 Status**:
- ✅ Can continue with full TDD confidence
- ✅ No workarounds needed
- ✅ Test-driven development fully restored
- 🎉 **CRITICAL BLOCKER REMOVED**

---

## Secondary Issue Discovered

### Issue: split() not available in test environment

While verifying the fix, discovered that `split()` builtin works in `ruchy run` but not in `ruchy test`:

```ruchy
let lines = split(content, "\n")  // Works in ruchy run, fails in ruchy test
```

**Error**: `Runtime error: Unknown builtin function: __builtin_split__`

**Workaround**: Implemented manual line parsing with character iteration
**Severity**: LOW - Has simple workaround
**Filed**: Not yet (minor issue, workaround exists)
