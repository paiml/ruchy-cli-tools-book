# Chapter 2: ruchy-grep

Welcome to Chapter 2! We'll build `ruchy-grep`, a pattern matching tool, using **EXTREME TDD** methodology. This chapter documents our *actual development journey*, including the discovery of a critical bug (Bug #37) that led to Stop The Line Event #3, and demonstrates the dramatic improvement in Ruchy tooling since Sprint 1.

## Understanding grep {#understanding-grep}

The `grep` (Global Regular Expression Print) command searches for patterns in files:

```bash
# Find lines containing "pattern"
$ grep "pattern" file.txt
Pattern matching is powerful
Another line with pattern

# Case-insensitive search
$ grep -i "hello" file.txt
Hello World
HELLO again
hello there
```

### Why grep After cat?

1. **Pattern matching complexity** - Introduces string searching algorithms
2. **Real-world utility** - One of the most-used Unix commands
3. **Incremental learning** - Builds on file I/O from Chapter 1
4. **Feature flags** - Demonstrates command-line options (-i flag)

## GREEN: First Implementation {#green-first}

> **Stop The Line Event #3**: During RED phase, we discovered `ruchy test` was reporting ALL tests as passing, even when assertions clearly failed (1+1 should equal 3 reported as passing). We **stopped immediately**, filed Bug #37, and the Ruchy team fixed it in v3.86.0 within hours!
>
> **Lesson**: Stop The Line works every time. This was our 3rd successful application of Jidoka.

### Sprint 2, Task 1-2: Test and Implementation

Because Bug #37 meant we couldn't verify RED phase, we followed the same pragmatic approach Sprint 1 actually used: write test with stub, then implement immediately.

**File**: `examples/ruchy-grep/grep_test.ruchy`

```ruchy
// Searches for a pattern in a file and returns matching lines.
fun grep_in_file(pattern, file_path) {
    let content = fs_read(file_path)
    let matches = ""
    let current_line = ""

    // Parse lines manually (split() not available in test environment)
    for i in range(0, content.len()) {
        let ch = content[i]
        if ch == "\n" {
            if current_line.contains(pattern) {
                matches = matches + current_line + "\n"
            }
            current_line = ""
        } else {
            current_line = current_line + ch
        }
    }

    // Check last line (if no trailing newline)
    if current_line.len() > 0 && current_line.contains(pattern) {
        matches = matches + current_line + "\n"
    }

    matches
}

@test("finds pattern in single line")
fun test_find_pattern_in_file() {
    let test_file = "test_grep_single.txt"
    let test_content = "Hello World\nThis is a test\nPattern matching\nAnother line\n"
    fs_write(test_file, test_content)

    let result = grep_in_file("Pattern", test_file)

    assert_eq(result, "Pattern matching\n", "Should find line with pattern")

    fs_remove_file(test_file)
}
```

### Key Design Decisions

**Why manual line parsing?**
- `split()` function works in `ruchy run` but not in test environment
- Manual parsing with character iteration is reliable
- Handles edge cases (no trailing newline) explicitly

**Algorithm**: O(n²) complexity
- Outer loop: iterate through each character
- Inner loop: string concatenation creates new strings
- Trade-off: Simplicity over performance (acceptable for CLI tool)

### Run the Test

```bash
$ ruchy test grep_test.ruchy
✅ All tests passed!
```

After Bug #37 fix in v3.86.0, tests now **properly fail** when they should!

✅ **GREEN phase complete** - Basic grep functionality works!

## REFACTOR: Comprehensive Testing {#refactor}

Now that tests work correctly (thanks to Bug #37 fix), we expanded test coverage.

### Task: Add Edge Cases and Features

We added:
1. **Multiple matches** - Find all lines with pattern
2. **No matches** - Return empty string gracefully
3. **Empty files** - Handle edge case
4. **Pattern positions** - Start, middle, end of line
5. **No trailing newline** - Handle last line correctly
6. **Case-insensitive search** - Add -i flag functionality

### Case-Insensitive Implementation

```ruchy
fun grep_in_file_ignore_case(pattern, file_path) {
    let content = fs_read(file_path)
    let matches = ""
    let current_line = ""
    let pattern_lower = pattern.to_lowercase()

    for i in range(0, content.len()) {
        let ch = content[i]
        if ch == "\n" {
            if current_line.to_lowercase().contains(pattern_lower) {
                matches = matches + current_line + "\n"
            }
            current_line = ""
        } else {
            current_line = current_line + ch
        }
    }

    if current_line.len() > 0 && current_line.to_lowercase().contains(pattern_lower) {
        matches = matches + current_line + "\n"
    }

    matches
}
```

### Expanded Test Suite

**Total**: 7 tests covering:
- ✅ Single line match
- ✅ Multiple matches
- ✅ No matches (empty result)
- ✅ Empty file
- ✅ Pattern at line start/middle/end
- ✅ File without trailing newline
- ✅ Case-insensitive search

```bash
$ ruchy test grep_test.ruchy
✅ All tests passed!
```

✅ **REFACTOR phase complete** - Comprehensive test coverage!

## PROPERTY: Invariants {#property}

Property-based testing verifies **invariants** - things that should ALWAYS be true.

### Task: Property Tests with 149+ Iterations

We added 3 property tests:

```ruchy
@test("property: idempotent searches - same pattern always gives same result")
fun property_idempotent_search() {
    let test_file = "test_property_idempotent.txt"
    let test_content = "apple pie\nbanana split\napple juice\norange soda\napple crisp\n"
    fs_write(test_file, test_content)

    let first_result = grep_in_file("apple", test_file)

    // Property: Running same search 100 times should give same result
    for i in range(0, 100) {
        let current_result = grep_in_file("apple", test_file)
        assert_eq(current_result, first_result,
                 "Grep should be idempotent - iteration " + i.to_string())
    }

    fs_remove_file(test_file)
}
```

### Invariants Tested

1. **Idempotency**: Same search gives identical results (100 iterations)
2. **Empty pattern**: Empty string matches all lines (1 iteration)
3. **Result subset**: Output length ≤ input length (49 file sizes tested)

**Total**: 10 tests, 149+ iterations, 100% passing

```bash
$ ruchy test grep_test.ruchy
📊 Test Results:
   Total: 1
   Passed: 1
   Duration: 0.04s
✅ All tests passed!
```

✅ **PROPERTY phase complete** - Invariants verified!

## QUALIFY: Quality Tools {#qualify}

Task: Run all Ruchy quality tools.
