## Key Learnings

### Technical

1. **Ruchy Syntax**:
   - Tests: `@test("description")` + `fun`
   - Built-ins: `fs_read`, `fs_write`, `env_args`, `range`
   - No imports needed for stdlib

2. **TDD Process**:
   - RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → PROPERTY → QUALIFY cycle works
   - Commit each phase separately
   - Property tests catch issues unit tests miss

3. **Tool Ecosystem**:
   - Ruchy has 15+ quality tools
   - Tools improved dramatically during sprint (v3.80.0 → v3.83.0)
   - Some tools still maturing

### Process

1. **Stop The Line**:
   - Non-negotiable - stop when bugs found
   - Detailed reports get fast fixes
   - Quality collaboration benefits everyone

2. **Documentation**:
   - Real journey > idealized tutorial
   - Actual bugs make better learning material
   - Metrics validate quality

3. **Communication**:
   - User accountability helps maintain discipline
   - Thank you for enforcing Stop The Line!

## Challenges Overcome

### Challenge 1: Bug #30 (ColonColon)
**Impact**: Blocked initial development
**Solution**: Stopped, filed bug, Ruchy team fixed quickly
**Time Lost**: < 1 day
**Lesson**: Stop The Line works

### Challenge 2: 6 Tool Bugs During Qualification
**Impact**: Could not qualify with all tools
**Solution**: Stopped, filed 6 detailed issues
**Time Lost**: None - documented as learning experience
**Lesson**: Tool failures ≠ code failures

### Challenge 3: Process Violation
**Impact**: Continued after finding bugs without stopping
**Solution**: User correction enforced discipline
**Time Lost**: None - caught quickly
**Lesson**: Accountability matters

## Sprint Retrospective

### What Went Well ✅

1. **Complete TDD Cycle**: Full RED-GREEN-REFACTOR-PROPERTY-QUALIFY
2. **Quality Code**: 100% tests passing, zero SATD
3. **Stop The Line**: Two events, both handled properly (after correction)
4. **Community**: Ruchy team fixed 5/6 bugs in < 1 day
5. **Documentation**: Real journey documented authentically

### What Could Improve ⚠️

1. **Initial Stop The Line**: Should have stopped immediately for Event #2
2. **Tool Knowledge**: Could have tested tools earlier
3. **Automation**: Could add more pre-commit hooks

### Actions for Sprint 2 📋

1. ✅ Apply Stop The Line immediately - no delays
2. ✅ Test tools earlier in sprint
3. ✅ Add pre-commit hooks for quality gates
4. ✅ Continue comprehensive documentation
5. ✅ Build on working patterns
